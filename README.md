# Transportation Equality @ NYC
## project summary
This is a team project for the Urban Science Intensive course at CUSP, NYU. In this project we try to calculate an index that reflects the inequality in transportation for every census blockgroup of NYC. The index has 3 components: the transportation cost / income ratio; the agony; and the transportation availability. See main.py for more details how each component is calculated as well as how they are combined together.
## data and reproducibility
The relevant data is provided in the folder data for reproducibility purpose.
- The income data and the census blockgroup shapefiles are acquired from [U.S. Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/).
- The commute origin and destination estimate is acquired from [LODES LEHD](http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/lodes/LODES7/LODESTechDoc7.0.pdf).
- The shapefiles for NYC subway and bus routes and stops were found in the[William and Anita Newman Library of Baruch College, CUNY].
- The bikelane shapefile is downloaded from [NYC Bike Maps](http://www.nycbikemaps.com/maps/manhattan-bike-map/).
